üè¶ SBI ATM Simulation System
A simple ATM application that works just like a real SBI cash machine. I built this to practice my Java skills and learn about banking applications.

What it does
This ATM simulator lets you:

Log in with account numbers and PINs
Check your account balance
Withdraw cash
Deposit money
Transfer funds between accounts
View your recent transactions
Change your PIN
I made it look and feel like a real Indian ATM with proper rupee (‚Çπ) symbols and SBI branding.

How to use it
Just download the code and run it on your computer. You'll need Java installed (version 17 or newer works best).

# To run with the nice graphical interface:
java ModernATMSystem
# Or to use the text-only version:
java ModernATMSystem console
Test it out
You can try these accounts to test the system:

Account Number	PIN	Name	Starting Balance
123456	1234	Rajesh Kumar	‚Çπ50,000
234567	2345	Priya Sharma	‚Çπ35,000
What I learned
Building this project helped me understand:

How to structure a Java application properly
Creating both text and graphical interfaces
How banking security works
Modern Java features and techniques
Technologies used
Java 21 (core language)
Java Swing (for the graphical interface)
Object-oriented programming principles
Modern Java features like records and text blocks
